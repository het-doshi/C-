// Object Orientd Programming in C++ OOP

/*** Why Object-Oriented Programming?
Before we discuss object-oriented programming, we need to learn why we need object-oriented programming?
C++ language was designed with the main intention of adding object-oriented programming to C language As the 
size of the program increases readability, maintainability, and bug-free nature of the program decrease.This 
was the major problem with languages like C which relied upon functions or procedure (hence the name 
procedural programming language)As a result, the possibility of not addressing the problem adequately was 
high Also, data was almost neglected, data security was easily compromisedUsing classes solves this problem by 
modeling program as a real-world scenario*/

/***Difference between Procedure Oriented Programming and Object-Oriented Programming

Procedure Oriented Programming: Consists of writing a set of instruction for the computer to follow
The main focus is on functions and not on the flow of data Functions can either use local or global data
Data moves openly from function to function.

Object-Oriented Programming : Works on the concept of classes and object A class is a template to create 
objectsTreats data as a critical element Decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and functions 
around the objects.

/**Basic Concepts in Object-Oriented Programming**
1. classes - Basic template for creating objects
2. Objects – Basic run-time entities
3. Data Abstraction & Encapsulation – Wrapping data and functions into a single unit
4. Inheritance – Properties of one class can be inherited into others
5. Polymorphism – Ability to take more than one forms
6. Dynamic Binding – Code which will execute is not known until the program runs
7. Message Passing – message (Information) call format

/* Benefits of Object-Oriented Programming
1. Better code reusability using objects and inheritance
2. Principle of data hiding helps build secure systems
3. Multiple Objects can co-exist without any interference
4. Software complexity can be easily managed
5. No Source Code Associated With This Video */
