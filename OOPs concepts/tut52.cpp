/* 

!Abstract Base Class in C++ :
Abstract base class is a class that has at least one pure virtual function in its body. 
The classes which are inheriting the base class must need to override the virtual function of the abstract 
class otherwise compiler will throw an error.

! Pure Virtual Functions in C++ :
Pure virtual function is a function that doesnâ€™t perform any operation and the function is declared by 
assigning the value 0 to it. Pure virtual functions are declared in abstract classes.
