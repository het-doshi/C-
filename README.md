# C++ Basics, Patterns, and OOPs Concepts 

Welcome to my C++ Patterns, Basics, and OOPs repository! This project contains implementations of various pattern programs and basic object-oriented programming concepts in C++.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Basic Concepts
### 2. Patterns 
### 3. OOPs Concepts

## Patterns

In the `patterns` directory, you'll find several C++ programs that generate different patterns using asterisks (\*). These patterns range from simple shapes to more complex designs. Here's a list of patterns available:
1. Numeric pattern
2. Alphabetical pattern
3. Binary pattern
4. Different shapes like pyramid, diamond, etc.

## Basic Concepts

In the `basics` directory, you'll find C++ programs that cover fundamental concepts of the language, including basic syntax and object-oriented programming principles. 
1. Data types
2. Control Structures
3. Functions

Additionally, in the `oops` directory, you'll find C++ programs that demonstrate object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the desired pattern or basic concept directory.
3. Compile the C++ file using a C++ compiler such as g++.
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
