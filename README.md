# C++ Basics, Patterns, OOPs, and STL Concepts

Welcome to my C++ repository! This project contains implementations of various pattern programs, basic concepts, object-oriented programming principles, and Standard Template Library (STL) concepts in C++.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Basic Concepts
### 2. Patterns
### 3. OOPs Concepts
### 4. STL Concepts

## Patterns

In the `patterns` directory, you'll find several C++ programs that generate different patterns using asterisks (\*). These patterns range from simple shapes to more complex designs. Here's a list of patterns available:
1. Numeric pattern
2. Alphabetical pattern
3. Binary pattern
4. Different shapes like pyramid, diamond, etc.

## Basic Concepts

In the `basics` directory, you'll find C++ programs that cover fundamental concepts of the language, including basic syntax and object-oriented programming principles:
1. Data types
2. Control Structures
3. Functions

## OOPs Concepts

Additionally, in the `oops` directory, you'll find C++ programs that demonstrate object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts:
1. Classes and Objects
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
4. Encapsulation
5. Abstraction

## STL Concepts

In the `stl` directory, you can explore various programs that utilize the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++:
1. Vectors
2. Lists
3. Maps
4. Sets
5. Queues
6. Stacks

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the desired pattern or basic concept directory.
3. Compile the C++ file using a C++ compiler such as g++.
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
